    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>From managing fleet dispatches to diving into the world of web development,
      my journey has been a testament to my adaptability and passion for learning.
      As a Junior Full Stack Web Developer, I’ve honed my skills across various technologies,
      with a special love for front-end development. The thrill of transforming a design into a fully functional,
      user-friendly interface is what drives me. My experience as a freelancer has further enriched my journey,
      allowing me to work on diverse projects and continuously learn new things.
      I pride myself on my ability to quickly pick up new skills and adapt to changing technologies.
      This journey is not just about changing careers,
      but also about personal growth and continuous learning.
      I’m excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in my web development career and look
      forward to making a significant contribution to the tech industry.</p>
